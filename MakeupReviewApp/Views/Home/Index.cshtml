            1️⃣ <strong>Sign up</strong> and create an account.<br />
            2️⃣ <strong>Explore products</strong> and read reviews from other users.<br />
            3️⃣ <strong>Write your own reviews</strong> and share your experience.<br />

        <h2>Upcomings</h2>
        <p>
            1️⃣ Logged in user can add more product to the product list<br />
            2️⃣ Product will have different categories/brands that user can filter between to see different result<br />
            3️⃣ Logged in user can add product to their wishlist, and the list will show in their profile page<br />
            4️⃣ Minor optimization: fix Product ID to Product name in user profile for better user experiences
